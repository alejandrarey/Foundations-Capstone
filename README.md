# Foundations-Capstone
This is the Capstone Project for Foundations

The name of my app is U-Turn Neighborhood Marketplace. 
It is intended to be a marketplace for a small community where users share and post items they are looking to buy and for users that have those items and can make an offer based on items descriptions and prices.
Once the “Buyer” gets a good offer, it can remove the item from the app and will stop receiving deals. 

Users can also rate the application.

3 MVPs of this app:
1.	Users can post new item cards
2.	Users can bid on items
3.	Users can remove item cards once offer was accepted.
